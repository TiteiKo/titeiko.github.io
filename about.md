My name is Marion Duprey and I'm a french developer.

I've been using Ruby since 2006 and professionally working with it since 2011\. I'm not a ruby developer. I'm a developer who loves Ruby wholehearteadly, but I don't limit myself to Ruby.

Where I work, I can dabble in anything I want, so I have a bit of experience dealing with system administration, deployments, apis, backend, frontend, smartphone apps, and other stuff.

I'm having a lot of fun (while, of course, doing a great job), and that's all that matters!
